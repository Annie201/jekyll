	              <p>The Programming Historian always welcomes suggestions and submissions from the community.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-are-looking-for">What we are looking for</h2>

<p>There is no single kind or standard lesson at The Programming Historian. We do insist that all lessons have a clearly defined goal and are written with a particular audience in mind. Ideally, readers must understand at the outset exactly what skills or results they will achieve by working on a lesson, and the lesson will conclude only after it has provided a tangible skill to the reader. We aim for lesson that take between 30 minutes and 1 hour to complete. More expansive lessons can be divided into smaller sub-lessons that can be worked through in sequence.</p>

<h2 id="why-bother">Why Bother</h2>

<p>From our own experiences as well as from our authors, we know that the difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the community by passing on some of the tacit knowledge gained along the way.</p>

<p>Another reason to get involved is that participation brings distinct professionalization benefits. We prominently feature the names of authors and reviewers on all of our lesson pages, as well as the contributors page, and new lessons tend to be frequently tweeted and retweeted. Because we average around 3000 unique visitors per month, The Programming Historian remains a vibrant and visible site for community collaboration and education.</p>

<h2 id="editorial-policy">Editorial Policy</h2>

<h2 id="open-source-open-access">Open Source, Open Access</h2>

<p>The Programming Historian is committed to open source and open access principles. All contributed lessons must make use of open source programming languages and open source software whenever possible. This policy is meant to minimize costs for all parties, and to allow the greatest possible level of participation. We believe everyone should be able to benefit from these tutorials, not just those with large research budgets for expensive proprietary software.</p>

<p>The Programming Historian also emphasizes sharing credit where it is due. Upon acceptance, authors agree to release their lesson under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license, also known as a “CC-BY” license. This means that you have the right to post your lesson to your blog, to your local newspaper, or to anywhere else you see fit without asking anyone’s permission.However, you grant PH and anyone else interested in your work the right to do the same as long as they list you as the author. This allows the lessons to have the greatest possible diffusion and impact.</p>

<h2 id="modularity">Modularity</h2>

<p>Rather than offering lessons in a set order, we present more of a smorgasbord, enabling readers to pick and choose whatever particular lessons seem most relevant for their task at hand. We aim for our lessons build and draw upon each other. As a author, this means that you don’t need to explain in detail smaller tasks, technologies, or techniques that have been explained in their own tutorials, but can focus on the problem you’re most interested in. This allows authors to write tutorials more directly aligned with their interests, and for us to minimize our repetition across lessons.</p>

<h2 id="technical-sustainability">Technical Sustainability</h2>

<p>Lessons must make every effort to use stable, non-deprecated (or soon to be deprecated) techniques, languages and software. Alpha versions of software should be avoided; Beta versions only used if they are extremely stable. We discourage operating-system specific tutorials, but we are happy to work with you to get your tutorial tested on other platforms so that everyone can learn from them.</p>

<h2 id="contact-us">Contact Us</h2>

<p>Please feel free to contact us with questions or suggestions. We’d love to hear from you.</p>
