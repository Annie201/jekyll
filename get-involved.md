As a way of editing lessons as fast as our contributors can generate
them, soliciting new lessons that would best serve our readers, and most
quickly responding to our readers’ needs, we’d love your help. We’re
particularly interested to engage with new editors who can help
recognize potential new lessons that would serve a particular community
need, and work with lesson authors to guide new lessons through the
revision process with an exacting eye for clarity and style.

We’re not asking for a long-term or an intensive commitment The workload
