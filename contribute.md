***There are 2 main ways to get involved with the _Programming Historian_***, either by contributing a lesson or helping with editorial work.

-----

## Contribute a Lesson
From our own experiences as well as from our authors, we know that the
difficult job of writing technically challenging but accessible
tutorials is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills
and actively engage in the community by passing on some of the tacit
knowledge gained along the way. 

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible.

## Join our editorial and review team
If writing a lesson isn't for you, perhpas 

-   Interested in teaching humanists about technology?

-   Want to learn new digital humanities tools and techniques, and help
    teach others about them?

-   Hankering for editorial experience you can get credit for?

-   Are you teaching a digital humanities course where students might
    produce lessons that could be published here?


### Work
As a way of editing lessons as fast as our contributors can generate
them, soliciting new lessons that would best serve our readers, and most
quickly responding to our readers’ needs, we’d love your help. We’re
particularly interested to engage with new editors who can help
recognize potential new lessons that would serve a particular community
need, and work with lesson authors to guide new lessons through the
revision process with an exacting eye for clarity and style.

### Committment and Time
Have you ever wanted some editorial experience? Want to help shape the kinds of
lessons that appear at _Programming Historian_? Whatever your interest and
availability, we’re happy to have your help whenever you can make
time for us. There is no minimum amount you have to do, and we won’t
randomly demand that you do something without asking.

We’re not asking for a long-term or an intensive commitment. The workload
can be however little or much as you’d like. Our hope to is to establish
a pool of editors so that all new lessons can be edited, revised, and
published as fast as possible without any bottlenecks, calling on whomever is available at that time.
