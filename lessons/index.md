The Original Programming Historian
----------------------------------

The *Programming Historian* was originally written as a series of lessons that
were intended to be followed in sequence. The other lessons on the site are mostly independent
of one another, and can be followed in any order.

-   [Introduction and Installation] (../lessons/introduction-and-installation)
-   Installation Instructions for [Mac](../lessons/mac-installation), [Linux](../lessons/linux-installation), or [Windows](../lessons/windows-installation)
-   [Viewing HTML Files](../lessons/viewing-html-files) <div class="toc-author"> William J. Turkel & Adam Crymble</div>

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
-----------------------------------------

APIs let you programmatically request specific information from a website. Learn how to use them.

-   [Intro to the Zotero API](../lessons/intro-to-the-zotero-api) <div class="toc-author"> Amanda Morton</div>
-   [Creating New Items in Zotero](../lessons/creating-new-items-in-zotero) <div class="toc-author">Amanda Morton</div>
-   [Counting Frequencies from Zotero Items](../lessons/counting-frequencies-from-zotero-items) <div class="toc-author">Spencer Roberts</div>



Data Management
---------------

You put a lot of effort into your research. Make sure that effort lasts
by adopting sustainable strategies to your code, your data, and your
research processes. A little bit of planning can save you a lot of time.

-   [Preserving Research Data](../lessons/preserving-your-research-data) <div class="toc-author">James Baker</div>
-   [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](../lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) <div class="toc-author">Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff</div>



Data Manipulation
-----------------

Just like it sounds, learn how to use programming to change, move,
clean, or count data. These are essential techniques for preparing data
to be used in various tools.

-   [Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](../lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) <div class="toc-author"> Seth van Hooland, Ruben Verborgh, Max De Wilde</div>
-   [Understanding Regular Expressions](../lessons/understanding-regular-expressions) <div class="toc-author">Doug Knox</div>
-   [Cleaning OCR’d Text with Regular Expressions](../lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions) <div class="toc-author">Laura Turner O’Hara</div>
-   [Transliterating non-ASCII Characters with Python](../lessons/transliterating) <div class="toc-author"> Seth Bernstein</div>



Getting Ready to Program
-------------------------
If you’re new to programming in python, you’ll first need to set up a programming environment. For the most flexibility, we recommend that you follow these instructions on [setting up python on the command
line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html).

Many of the tutorials require that you install one or more python modules to save you time coding. If this is a new concept for you, read about how to [Install Python Modules](../lessons/installing-python-modules-pip).



Mapping and GIS
---------------

Mapping can be an effective way to visualize and interpret historical
data. These lessons introduce historical geographic information systems
(GIS) using open source software.

-   [Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth](../lessons/googlemaps-googleearth) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>
-   [Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers](../lessons/qgis-layers) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>
-   [Creating New Vector Layers in QGIS 2.0](../lessons/vector-layers-qgis) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>
-   [Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0](../lessons/georeferencing-qgis) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>



Omeka Exhibit Building
----------------------

Learn how to present historical materials online.

-   [Up and Running with Omeka.net](../lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka) <div class="toc-author">Miriam Posner</div>
-   [Creating an Omeka.net Exhibit](../lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit) <div class="toc-author">Miriam Posner</div>



Topic Modeling
--------------

A topic modeling tool takes a single text (or corpus)  and looks for patterns in the use of words; it is an attempt to inject semantic meaning into vocabulary. It can help you to very quickly find ‘topics’ in a large corpus of texts.

-   [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET](../lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) <div class="toc-author"> Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, & Ian Milligan</div>
