Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
-----------------------------------------

APIs let you programmatically request specific information from a
website. Learn how to use them.

-   [Introduction to the Zotero API](../lessons/intro-to-the-zotero-api.html)
-   [Creating New Items in Zotero](../lessons/creating-new-items-in-zotero.html)
-   [Counting Frequencies from Zotero
    Items](../lessons/counting-frequencies-from-zotero-items.html)

Data Manipulation
-----------------

Just like it sounds, learn how to use programming to change, move,
clean, or count data. These are essential techniques for preparing data
to be used in various tools.

-   [Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](../lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine)
-   [Normalizing Data](../lessons/normalizing-data)
-   [Counting Frequency](../lessons/counting-frequencies)
-   [Understanding Regular
    Expressions](../lessons/understanding-regular-expressions)
-   [Cleaning OCR’d Text with Regular
    Expressions](../lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions)
-   [Transliterating non-ASCII Characters with
    Python](../lessons/transliterating)

Document Management and Editing
-------------------------------

-   [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and
    Markdown](../lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

Mapping and GIS
---------------

Mapping can be an effective way to visualize and interpret historical
data. These lessons introduce historical geographic information systems
(GIS) using open source software.

-   [Introduction to Google Maps and Google
    Earth](../lessons/googlemaps-googleearth)
-   [Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers](../lessons/qgis-layers)
-   [Creating New Vector Layers in QGIS
    2.0](../lessons/vector-layers-qgis)
-   [Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0](../lessons/georeferencing-qgis)

Omeka Exhibit Building
----------------------

Learn how to present historical materials online.

-   [Up and Running with
    Omeka.net](../lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka)
-   [Creating an Omeka.net
    Exhibit](../lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit)

Python Programming Basics
-------------------------

Some introductory lessons for basic techniques in Python. If you’re new
to programming in python, you’ll first need to set up a programming
environment. For the most flexibility, we recommend that you follow
these instructions on [setting up python on the command
line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

As an alternative to using the command line, many text editors are able
to run python code within the editor. Some older python tutorials listed
here reference one of these tools, called Komodo Edit. You can install
this for [Mac](../lessons/mac-installation),
[Linux](../lessons/linux-installation), or
[Windows](../lessons/windows-installation).

-   [Installing Python
    Modules](../lessons/installing-python-modules-pip)
-   [Code Reuse and Modularity](../lessons/code-reuse-and-modularity)
-   [Manipulating Strings in
    Python](../lessons/manipulating-strings-in-python)
-   [Working with Text Files](../lessons/working-with-text-files)
-   [Viewing HTML Files](../lessons/viewing-html-files)

Topic Modeling
--------------

A topic modeling tool takes a single text (or corpus) and looks for
patterns in the use of words; it is an attempt to inject semantic
meaning into vocabulary. It can help you to very quickly find ‘topics’
in a large corpus of texts.

-   [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and
    MALLET](../lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)

Web Scraping
------------

Learn how to use programming to download material from the Internet in a
controlled, semi-automated manner.

    Collection](../lessons/data-mining-the-internet-archive)
-   [Automated Downloading with
    Wget](../lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget)
