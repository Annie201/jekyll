Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
-----------------------------------------

APIs let you programmatically request specific information from a
website. Learn how to use them.

-   [Intro to the Zotero API](../lessons/intro-to-the-zotero-api) <div class="toc-author"> Amanda Morton</div>
-   [Creating New Items in Zotero](../lessons/creating-new-items-in-zotero) <div class="toc-author">Amanda Morton</div>
-   [Counting Frequencies from Zotero Items](../lessons/counting-frequencies-from-zotero-items) <div class="toc-author">Spencer Roberts</div>

Data Management
---------------

You put a lot of effort into your research. Make sure that effort lasts
by adopting sustainable strategies to your code, your data, and your
research processes. A little bit of planning can save you a lot of time.

-   [Preserving Research Data](../lessons/preserving-your-research-data) <div class="toc-author">James Baker</div>

Data Manipulation
-----------------

Just like it sounds, learn how to use programming to change, move,
clean, or count data. These are essential techniques for preparing data
to be used in various tools.

-   [Transliterating non-ASCII Characters with Python](../lessons/transliterating) <div class="toc-author"> Seth Bernstein</div>

Mapping and GIS
---------------

Mapping can be an effective way to visualize and interpret historical
data. These lessons introduce historical geographic information systems
(GIS) using open source software.

-   [Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth](../lessons/googlemaps-googleearth) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>

-   [Creating New Vector Layers in QGIS 2.0](../lessons/vector-layers-qgis) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>
-   [Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0](../lessons/georeferencing-qgis) <div class="toc-author"> Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, Daniel Macfarlane</div>

Omeka Exhibit Building
----------------------

Learn how to present historical materials online.

-   [Up and Running with Omeka.net](../lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka) <div class="toc-author">Miriam Posner
-   [Creating an Omeka.net Exhibit](../lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit) <div class="toc-author">Miriam Posner

Python Programming Basics
-------------------------

Some introductory lessons for basic techniques in Python. If you’re new
to programming in python, you’ll first need to set up a programming
environment. For the most flexibility, we recommend that you follow
these instructions on [setting up python on the command
line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

As an alternative to using the command line, many text editors are able to run
python code within the editor. Some older python tutorials listed here
reference one of these tools, called Komodo Edit. You can install this for
[Mac](../lessons/mac-installation), [Linux](../lessons/linux-installation), or [Windows](../lessons/windows-installation).

-   [Installing Python Modules](../lessons/installing-python-modules-pip) <div class="toc-author">Fred Gibbs, Ben Hurwitz, Amanda Morton</div>
-   [Code Reuse and Modularity](../lessons/code-reuse-and-modularity) <div class="toc-author">William J. Turkel & Adam Crymble</div>
-   [Manipulating Strings in Python](../lessons/manipulating-strings-in-python) <div class="toc-author"> William J. Turkel & Adam Crymble</div>
-   [Working with Text Files](../lessons/working-with-text-files) <div class="toc-author"> William J. Turkel & Adam Crymble</div>
-   [Viewing HTML Files](../lessons/viewing-html-files) <div class="toc-author"> William J. Turkel & Adam Crymble</div>

Topic Modeling
--------------

A topic modeling tool takes a single text (or corpus)  and looks for
patterns in the use of words; it is an attempt to inject semantic
meaning into vocabulary. It can help you to very quickly find ‘topics’
in a large corpus of texts.

-   [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET](../lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) <div class="toc-author"> Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, & Ian Milligan</div>
