As you may have noticed, we’ve changed the way we’ve structured lessons
on the Programming Historian. We’ve been working to include lessons
about a wider range of topics than our initial all-Python, all-the-time
version, and so we’re experimenting with ways to organize them.

We still have some kinks to work out with organization and display, and
we really appreciate your patience as we work through them. In the
meantime, by request, here’s a list of the lessons in their original
order:

[Your First Lesson][]

[Getting Started with Online Sources][]

[Working with Files and Web Pages][]

[From HTML to a List of Words ][]

[Computing Frequencies][]

[Wrapping Output in HTML][]

[Keywords in Context (KWIC)][]

[Downloading Multiple Records Using Query Strings ][]

[Automated Downloading with Wget][]

[Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET][]

Look for more updates soon as we continue to add lessons and work on our
organizational setup.
