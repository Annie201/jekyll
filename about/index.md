title: About Programming Historian
---

If you’d like to learn some simple programming skills to further your research process, you’ve come to the right place. The Programming Historian 2 (PH2) is a tutorial-based open access textbook designed to teach humanists practical computer programming skills that are immediately useful to real research needs.

But we haven’t stopped there. PH2 is also a community-driven collaborative textbook. We welcome lessons and lesson ideas from anyone who thinks they have a programming skill or technique that they’d like to share. All of our lessons are peer-reviewed before they are incorporated as part of the live project to ensure only high quality work reaches our learners.

If you’d like to learn some programming, come on in. If you’d like to contribute a lesson, drop us a line and let us know what you have in mind. We’d be happy to hear from individuals, or even classes looking to contribute a lesson or set of lessons. There’s no better way to learn something than to have to explain it to someone else!

Happy programming.
